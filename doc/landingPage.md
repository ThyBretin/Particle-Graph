## ParticleGraph's Purpose

### The Ultimate Context File for Your Application
ParticleGraph creates a comprehensive yet optimized context file that serves as the single source of truth for your application. Unlike raw code dumps that overwhelm AI models, ParticleGraph extracts the essential relationships, dependencies, and intents that define your project.

### Extract Project Intent from Codebase
While AI can scan syntax and semantics, it often misses the crucial "why" behind your code. ParticleGraph bridges this gap by mapping relationships between components and preserving developer intent. It transforms scattered code into a coherent narrative that both humans and AI can understand.

### Maximum Context with Maximum Relevancy
Even the largest AI context windows get diluted with irrelevant information. ParticleGraph solves this by intelligently prioritizing what matters most. It ensures that both developers and AI assistants work with high-relevance context that focuses on the components and relationships that actually matter to the task at hand.

### Optimize AI Token Usage
Token costs add up quickly when working even with "small" codebases. ParticleGraph dramatically reduces these costs through structured metadata and smart compression. By providing AI with a pre-processed graph of your application instead of raw files, you get better results while using fewer tokens.

### Seamless Integration via MCP
ParticleGraph's (MCP) approach enables frictionless integration with existing development environments and workflows. The graph becomes an intuitive interface between humans and AI, allowing both technical and non-technical team members to interact with complex codebases efficiently through simple, powerful commands.

## How It Works

### 1. Connect Your Repository
Authenticate with GitHub and select the repository you want to analyze. ParticleGraph works with any JavaScript or TypeScript project.

### 2. Generate Particles & Graphs
Our Workers crawl your repository, to extract structured metadata from each files as Particles, and generate Graphs.

### 3. Access Via MCP or Webapp
Retrieve your project's graphs and Particles through robust MCP endpoints optimized for AI assistants and IDEs, or explore through our lightweight webapp.

### 4. Refine With xAI
Use our xAI chat to refine Particles into SuperParticles, enhancing your code context with deeper insights and intelligence.
Your graph will now reflect your codebase and, project reference file.
