Updated Blueprint: Cloud-Based ParticleGraph Architecture with Library Definition Matching
Overview
This architecture runs entirely on Cloudflare, with the Worker handling all graph operations: fetching files from GitHub, parsing them, matching functions to library definitions, generating particles, creating/updating the graph, and refining with SuperParticles via ParticleThis(). The Model Context Protocol (MCP) fetches the graph for the AI in the IDE, Cloudflare R2 stores data, Cloudflare Pages hosts the web app, GitHub provides file access and commit notifications, Lemon Squeezy manages subscriptions, and xAI powers the advanced chat. The new feature matches user-defined functions with library definitions before refining them into SuperParticles, providing a more accurate and context-rich graph.
Components

Cloudflare Worker:
Handles all graph operations: fetching files from GitHub, parsing files with Babel, matching functions to library definitions, generating particles (addParticle()), creating/updating the graph (createGraph(), updateGraph()), and refining with ParticleThis().

Endpoints: /createGraph, /loadGraph, /updateGraph, /particleThis, /getLibraryDefs.

Manages library definition matching and SuperParticle creation.

Cloudflare R2:
Stores graphs (graphs/${projectId}.json), particles (particles/${projectId}/${filePath}.json), and library definitions (libraryDefs/${libraryName}.json).

Library definitions are preloaded into R2 for common libraries (e.g., React, Lodash) and include function signatures, descriptions, and usage examples.

Cloudflare Pages (Web App):
Hosts the user-facing web app with an advanced chat UI for graph refinement (ParticleThis()), SuperParticle creation, and codebase insights.

Includes GitHub OAuth and a dashboard for project management.

Model Context Protocol (MCP):
A JavaScript module in the IDE (e.g., Cursor) that fetches the graph from the Worker (/loadGraph) for AI context.

xAI via AI Gateway:
Powers the advanced chat, handling ParticleThis() for SuperParticle creation and intent refinement.

GitHub Integration:
OAuth for repo access to fetch files.

Webhooks to notify the Worker of commits.

Lemon Squeezy:
Manages subscriptions ($5/month/user, 1 project), with a free tier.

Library Definition Matching:
Matches functions in the user’s codebase to their library definitions (e.g., useState to React’s useState definition).

Library definitions are stored in R2 (libraryDefs/${libraryName}.json) and include:
Function name (e.g., useState).

Library (e.g., React).

Signature (e.g., useState(initialValue)).

Description (e.g., “Manages state in a functional component”).

Example usage (e.g., const [count, setCount] = useState(0);).

Example libraryDefs/react.json:
json

{
  "useState": {
    "library": "React",
    "signature": "useState(initialValue)",
    "description": "Manages state in a functional component",
    "example": "const [count, setCount] = useState(0);"
  },
  "useEffect": {
    "library": "React",
    "signature": "useEffect(callback, dependencies)",
    "description": "Handles side effects in a functional component",
    "example": "useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, [dependency]);"
  }
}

The Worker uses these definitions to match functions in the user’s code, then refines them into SuperParticles with ParticleThis().

User Flow
Signup and Initial Graph Creation with Library Matching:
User Action: The user signs up via the web app (Cloudflare Pages), authenticates with Lemon Squeezy, and grants GitHub access via OAuth.

Process:
The web app sends the repo details to the Worker (/createGraph).

The Worker fetches the repo’s files from GitHub and parses them with Babel to identify functions (e.g., useState, fetchData).

The Worker loads library definitions from R2 (e.g., libraryDefs/react.json) and matches functions in the codebase to their library definitions:
Example: In EventLocation.js, the Worker finds useState and matches it to React’s useState definition.

The Worker generates particles (addParticle()), including the matched library definitions, and creates the graph (createGraph()).

The graph and particles are stored in R2.

User Feedback: The web app displays “Graph created with library definitions matched!”

IDE Usage with MCP:
User Action: The user asks the AI in their IDE (e.g., Cursor) to implement a feature (e.g., “Add user-defined addresses to Event Location”).

Process:
The AI uses MCP to fetch the graph:
javascript

const graph = await fetch('https://worker.example.workers.dev/loadGraph?projectId=123&feature=Events', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <api-token>' },
}).then(res => res.json());

The graph includes matched library definitions (e.g., useState with its React definition), providing richer context for the AI.

The AI implements the feature, and the user commits the changes to GitHub.

User Feedback: The AI responds, “I’ve added user-defined addresses using useState for state management.”

Graph Update Post-Commit:
User Action: The user commits their changes to GitHub.

Process:
A GitHub webhook notifies the Worker (/updateGraph).

The Worker fetches the commit diff, parses changed files, matches new functions to library definitions, updates particles, and refreshes the graph in R2.

The Worker prepares SuperParticle suggestions based on new or updated functions.

User Feedback: The web app notifies: “New changes detected—refine your graph?”

Web App Refinement with Advanced Chat (SuperParticle Creation):
User Action: The user logs into the web app to refine the graph.

Process:
The web app shows a dashboard with the project’s graph, including matched library definitions (e.g., “Events uses useState from React”).

The user opens the advanced chat UI:
xAI: “I matched setUserAddress in Events to a custom function, but it uses useState from React. Should I create a SuperParticle for setUserAddress?”

User: “Yes, it handles user-defined addresses.”

xAI: “SuperParticle created: ‘setUserAddress: Handles user-defined addresses using React’s useState.’ Should I add more context, like event scheduling?”

User: “Yes.”

xAI: “Updated SuperParticle: ‘setUserAddress: Handles user-defined addresses and event scheduling using React’s useState.’”

The Worker calls xAI via /particleThis, updates the graph with the SuperParticle, and stores it in R2.

User Feedback: The web app confirms, “Graph updated with new SuperParticle!”

Process Details
Library Definition Matching:
The Worker parses files with Babel to extract function calls and imports.

It identifies the libraries used (e.g., import { useState } from 'react') and loads the corresponding library definitions from R2.

It matches functions to their definitions (e.g., useState to React’s useState) and adds this metadata to the particles.

Graph Creation (/createGraph):
Fetch files, parse with Babel, match functions to library definitions, generate particles, and create the graph.

Graph Fetching (MCP, /loadGraph):
MCP fetches the graph, including library definitions and SuperParticles, for the AI.

Graph Update (/updateGraph):
Webhook triggers the Worker to update the graph with new library matches and SuperParticle suggestions.

SuperParticle Creation (/particleThis):
The advanced chat refines matched functions into SuperParticles, adding intent and logic (e.g., “setUserAddress: Handles user-defined addresses”).

Cost Estimate (1,000 Users)
Cloudflare Workers: $0.59/month.

Cloudflare R2: $3.06/month (includes storage for library definitions, ~1MB total).

Cloudflare Pages: $0/month.

GitHub API: $50/month.

xAI: $45/month.

Lemon Squeezy: $750/month.

Total: $848.65/month.

Revenue: $5,000/month.

Profit: $4,151.35/month (83% margin).

Benefits of Library Definition Matching
Accuracy: Matching functions to library definitions provides a more precise starting point than parser-based extraction, as it leverages official library metadata.

Context: The AI in the IDE gets richer context (e.g., knowing useState is React’s state management hook), improving feature implementation.

Refinement: SuperParticles build on library definitions, adding user-specific intent and logic, making the graph more actionable.
