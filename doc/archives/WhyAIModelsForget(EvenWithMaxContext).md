Why AI Models Forget (Even with Max Context)
Even with huge context windows (e.g., DeepSeek v3’s rumored 128k+ tokens, GPT-4’s 32k, or xAI’s own hefty limits), AIs still “forget” or lose track. Here’s why:
Attention Limits:
How It Works: Transformers (the tech behind most AIs) use attention mechanisms to weigh input tokens. With massive context, attention gets diluted—early tokens fade as new ones pile in.

Result: Details from the start of a big codebase (e.g., a core module) might get fuzzy by the time the AI processes later parts.

Token Overload:
Reality: A 128k token context sounds huge, but a big codebase (say, 100k lines) can easily exceed it when tokenized (1 line ≈ 4-10 tokens). Compression helps, but nuance gets lost.

Result: The AI might skip or misremember files outside its window.

No True Memory:
Unlike Humans: We build mental models over time. AIs process context in one shot per query—no persistent memory across sessions unless explicitly engineered (e.g., via embeddings or external stores).

Result: Ask it about a file it saw 10 queries ago? It’s gone unless re-fed.

Reasoning Bias:
Focus: AIs prioritize patterns and recent input over exhaustive retention. They’re great at “gist” but weak at perfect recall of sprawling details.

Result: It might ace a coding task in isolation but miss how it fits a 500-file project.
