DeepSeek v3 and Coding Prowess
DeepSeek v3’s performance on coding tasks is wild—rumors say it’s nearing human-level on benchmarks like HumanEval or LeetCode. It could whip up a project from scratch (e.g., a web app) with scary precision. But your hunch—that AIs shine at starting projects but falter at extending big codebases—feels right to me. Here’s why:
Strengths: Starting Fresh
Clean Slate: AIs excel when given a clear spec (e.g., “Build a React app with auth”). They generate cohesive code, follow best practices, and leverage their training on millions of repos.

Small Scope: Early projects fit neatly in context—10 files, 5k tokens, no problem.

Example: DeepSeek v3 could nail a ParticleGraph prototype in one go—Worker, R2, basic graph logic.

Weaknesses: Extending Big Codebases
Context Crunch: A 100k-line codebase (e.g., 400k tokens) won’t fit. Even with chunking, it’s hard to grasp interdependencies across files.

Consistency: Adding a feature (e.g., “Add JWT auth”) requires understanding existing auth hooks, routes, and services—details easily lost in a sea of tokens.

Forgetting: Mid-task, it might “forget” a variable defined 50 files ago or mismatch the project’s style.

Example: Tell DeepSeek to add a feature to a mature Next.js app—it might break routing or duplicate logic because it missed the big picture.
